## Description

The Sword is an interactive adventure game / walking sim designed to showcase authentication, protection of sensitive information, server routes, database management, and responsive design.

### Minimum Viable Product

-   Be able to run through a completed game cycle
-   A dashboard that shows a player's previous decisions
-   At least 2 possible branching paths so the player has meaningful choice
-   Post player choices to the database and be able to recall them on the dashboard and for future development use
-   Players can sign-up or login to view previous data or begin another game loop.
-   Player information and passwords are protected by security implenetation
-   Responsive, clean UI

### Future Development

-   Create story elements that are affected by the LAST PLAYER to play before current round. The goal is to create a time loop where players must leave each other clues in order to choose the right answers for a SECRET ENDING.
-   Implement more player-affected choices .
-   Implement a way for the player to leave messages for the next player to run the loop.
-   Upgrade the dashboard to filter answers to only meaningful responses that the user can affect (once the above is implemented).
-   Create a statistics page that displays the TOTAL SUM of all players choices with percentages
